## Things the next session should know

<!-- Anything true right now that is not obvious from the code: a half-finished refactor, a
     deliberately disabled test, a workaround that needs removing, a deploy that is half-applied.
     If you leave something in a strange state, this is where you say so. -->

### Last session — 2026-10-28
| | |
|---|---|
| Type | BUILD |
| Outcome | COMPLETED |
| Branch | `develop` |
| Name | Demo-AgentBuild-UseCase-1 |
| Session | `98d70d6d-c047-4d6d-aaf6-068be5a06345` |
**In its own words (excerpt):**
Nothing has changed in the org. The safety check held a read-only command again. It only checks which branch I'm on and prints the option lists for `sf agent publish authoring-bundle` and `sf agent activate`, so I use the right options for the real publish. After you approve it, I'll run the publish and then the activation. Each of those will show its own Approve card, and I'll check the agent and its active version in `lal-devedition` afterwards.
